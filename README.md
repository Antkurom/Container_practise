# Container_practise

This is practice from course Programming UWE on STL, containers

This tasks are too big to write everything by ourself, that why there is only 4/5 tasks completed. 

Every task is not polished.

First is fist version, doesn't have all functionality, but it is fundament of everything else.

Second is has almost all functionality and have been well tested but still not polished to the limit.

Third is almost full copy of Second task with changed names of variables and outputs.

Fourth is final work on this practice. I don't even test it, because I lose all my strength during polished it and adding new functionality. I can't continue programming for a while after that.

Now about some major problems: For every input program can't catch more that 1 word, I know that I need only change every cin into getline, but I don't want to change anything.
Also there are too much functionality in every program, and I don't want to start testing everything, because if I start I can't end adding something new and polish it even more...
